It is an implementation of the Mars Rover Kata exercise, where you are exploring Mars by sending remotely controlled vehicles to the surface of the planet, and you need to develop an "API" that translates the commands sent from earth to instructions that are understood by the rover you sent.

                          However, that typical implementation of this exercise was only half of the project. I needed to learn Angular and TypeScript in order to create a functioning, real-time UI for the rover, which includes the following features:</p>

                            The T.R.E.K. project consists of a react web-application, a kiosk system, and a postgreSQL database behind them:

                          America since Kindergarten, learning important life skills and survival skills, starting
                          with the Lion Scout Rank in the Cub Scouts program. From that early age, I have been
                          exposed to backpacking, hiking, camping, wilderness
                          shelter-building, canoeing, kayaking, white water rafting, and much much more.
                          love visiting beautiful natural places, whether that be the Grand Canyon, the Sangre
                          De Cristo (Blood of Christ) mountains of New Mexico, or the Appalacian Trail of the
                          East.

                          As of late 2018, I have moved from
                          being a youth member to participating as a Scoutmaster, doing my best to mentor the next
                          generation of Boy Scouts towards their Eagle Scout ranks. My involvement in the B.S.A. &
                          affinity for outdoor activities has influenced two of my proudest
                          accomplishments to-date: <br><br>

                            <li>I conducted meetings with the staff of The Children's Center and the State, managing resources,

                              work on the only project related to the outdoors, an open-source project located in the Adirondack
                              Mountains. This project turned out to be the <a href="#trek-proj" style="text-decoration:underline">T.R.E.K. Project</a>

                            <li>I was excited about the possibility of contributing to the modernization of Trails across the
                              United States, and perhaps the world; As one who loves to go hiking, camping, etc., pen and paper
                              Trail logging systems are inefficient, out of date, and would take too much manpower to use efficiently.
                              This project provided an opportunity to move towards a solution to this!

                        About halfway through my career at RIT, I learned of a TTRPG design course being offered by the games
                        design department, where apparently students create entire TTRPGs in a single semester. I was elated
                        at the opportunity, and took the class! The project below was the result:<br><br>
