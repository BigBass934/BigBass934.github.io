# Portfolio Website Project

This is a portfolio website that I have created for myself! It includes my background, work experience, projects I've worked on, and my interests!

It is written completely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only, as a personal challenge to improve my hard skills at those basics, instead of relying on bootstraps & utilities from frameworks like React to do the work for me.
